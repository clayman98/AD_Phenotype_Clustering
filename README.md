# Distinct Medical and Substance Use Histories Associate with Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease
This project aimed to use hierarchical clustering to identify distinct subgroups of patients with Alzheimer's Disease based on their basic medical and substance use histories that would be collected at any routine primary care visit. We also sought to determine if these clusters had significantly different rates of cognitive decline in a two year follow-up period.
